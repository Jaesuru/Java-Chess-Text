# Java Chess Game
This is a simple console-based chess game built with Java using IntelliJ. The game allows two players to play a standard game of chess, taking turns to move their pieces. The game is implemented in the Test class and uses custom classes from the game package to manage the chessboard, pieces, and game logic.

- Command-based Gameplay:
  - mv (move): Move a piece to a new position.
  - cp (capture): Capture an opponent's piece.
  - undo: Undo the last move.
  - print status: Display the current state of the board.
- Input Validation: Validates movement commands to ensure they follow chess rules.
